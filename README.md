## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Transforming Smallholder Farming Through Digital Innovation</h3>
<p>To address the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers, we propose “Kisan Saathi”, a multilingual, AI-powered mobile and voice-based advisory platform that integrates scientific knowledge, financial services, and market access into a single ecosystem. This solution will provide real-time, location-specific crop and soil recommendations, weather alerts, and pest/disease detection through image or voice inputs. By offering voice-first interaction in local languages and offline functionality, even low-literate farmers can easily access timely, reliable advice. In addition, Kisan Saathi will connect farmers with microloans, crop insurance, subsidies, and market price information, reducing dependency on intermediaries and enabling better decision-making. This holistic approach aims to improve productivity, reduce costs, enhance sustainability, and uplift the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers.</p>

## Technical Approach
<h3>Precision Farming Intelligence</h3>
<p>
  The proposed “Kisan Saathi” platform will be developed as a modular, scalable cloud-based system with both mobile and voice interfaces to ensure accessibility for all farmers. Real-time data on soil, weather, and market conditions will be collected from government databases, satellite feeds, IoT sensors, and farmer inputs, and integrated with agriculture APIs for accurate crop and pest information. An AI and analytics engine will power the core functionalities, using machine learning to recommend crop selection, fertilizer usage, and pest management, while computer vision models enable pest and disease detection from uploaded images. Natural Language Processing (NLP) will support multilingual chat and voice-first interaction, making the platform usable by low-literate farmers through speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies. The app will also work in offline and low-bandwidth environments with SMS and IVR support for farmers without smartphones. Continuous feedback from users will help refine AI models and advisory content, while secure cloud infrastructure, data encryption, and role-based access will ensure privacy and data protection for all stakeholders.
