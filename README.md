## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3>Transforming Smallholder Farming Through Digital Innovation</h3>
<p>To address the challenges faced by small and marginal farmers, we propose “Kisan Saathi”, a multilingual, AI-powered mobile and voice-based advisory platform that integrates scientific knowledge, financial services, and market access into a single ecosystem. This solution will provide real-time, location-specific crop and soil recommendations, weather alerts, and pest/disease detection through image or voice inputs. By offering voice-first interaction in local languages and offline functionality, even low-literate farmers can easily access timely, reliable advice. In addition, Kisan Saathi will connect farmers with microloans, crop insurance, subsidies, and market price information, reducing dependency on intermediaries and enabling better decision-making. This holistic approach aims to improve productivity, reduce costs, enhance sustainability, and uplift the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers.</p>

## Technical Approach
<h3>Precision Farming Intelligence</h3>
<p>
  The proposed “Kisan Saathi” platform will be developed as a modular, scalable cloud-based system with both mobile and voice interfaces to ensure accessibility for all farmers. Real-time data on soil, weather, and market conditions will be collected from government databases, satellite feeds, IoT sensors, and farmer inputs, and integrated with agriculture APIs for accurate crop and pest information. An AI and analytics engine will power the core functionalities, using machine learning to recommend crop selection, fertilizer usage, and pest management, while computer vision models enable pest and disease detection from uploaded images. Natural Language Processing (NLP) will support multilingual chat and voice-first interaction, making the platform usable by low-literate farmers through speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies. The app will also work in offline and low-bandwidth environments with SMS and IVR support for farmers without smartphones. Continuous feedback from users will help refine AI models and advisory content, while secure cloud infrastructure, data encryption, and role-based access will ensure privacy and data protection for all stakeholders.

## Feasibility and Viability
<h3>Kisan Saathi – Smart Advisory Feasibility</h3>
<p>
  The feasibility of “Kisan Saathi” – A One-Stop Smart Advisory Ecosystem is strong due to increasing smartphone penetration, affordable data, and growing digital literacy in rural India, which enable farmers to access mobile apps, WhatsApp bots, or call-based advisory systems. Technically, the platform can leverage AI/ML for personalized crop advisory, IoT sensors for soil and weather monitoring, and satellite imagery for real-time alerts, while integrating with government databases such as soil health cards and weather services. Operationally, it can be rolled out in phases—beginning with mobile and voice-based support in regional languages and later expanding to IoT sensors or village kiosks—supported by partnerships with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), NGOs, agri-input companies, and cooperatives. Financially, initial development can be backed by government schemes, CSR initiatives, or agri-tech investors, while sustainable revenue streams may come from premium subscriptions, agri-input commissions, B2B tie-ups, and data insights. The viability of “Kisan Saathi” lies in its ability to reduce farmers’ costs, improve productivity, and empower small and marginal farmers with actionable knowledge while bridging the digital divide. Socially, it enhances trust and accessibility through localized content, and economically it creates employment opportunities for rural youth. In the long term, the ecosystem is scalable across states and crops, can integrate future innovations like crop insurance and precision farming, and builds a large data repository to improve AI-based recommendations, ensuring self-sustainability and lasting impact.

## Impact and Benefits
<h3>Empowering Every Farmer</h3>
<p>The “Kisan Saathi” platform will create a transformative impact on India’s agriculture by increasing farm productivity through timely, personalized guidance on crop selection, pest management, irrigation, and fertilizer use, resulting in higher yields and improved produce quality. By providing data-driven recommendations, it helps farmers minimize excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and water, significantly reducing input costs while preserving soil health. This approach enhances farmers’ income and profitability by lowering expenses and enabling them to access better market prices. The platform empowers small and marginal farmers through localized content, regional languages, and voice-based systems, bridging the digital divide and making smart farming accessible to even low-literacy users. In addition, it promotes environmental sustainability by encouraging precision farming practices, conserving resources, and reducing chemical overuse. “Kisan Saathi” also supports rural development by creating employment opportunities for local youth as field coordinators, kiosk operators, and digital facilitators. Over time, it builds a rich agricultural data ecosystem that enables more accurate AI-driven predictions, future crop insurance models, and innovative financial tools while strengthening linkages between farmers, government bodies, NGOs, and agri-businesses. Altogether, it fosters a sustainable, inclusive, and technology-driven future for Indian agriculture.</p>

## Research and References
<h3>AgroStar Case Study</h3>
<p>
  AgroStar, a leading AgriTech company in India, has developed a cloud-based digital platform that empowers farmers with personalized agronomy advice, high-quality agricultural inputs, and access to markets. Their flagship mobile application, Agri-Doctor, provides tailored guidance on crop selection, pest management, irrigation, and fertilization, and supports 11 regional languages, ensuring accessibility for farmers across the country. Designed to work even in low-connectivity areas, the app also fosters a community for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. AgroStar’s transition to cloud infrastructure enables real-time analytics, predictive machine learning models for disease detection and yield optimization, and seamless updates across millions of devices. Additionally, their omnichannel delivery model—combining mobile apps, advisory centers, and over 10,000 retail stores—ensures farmers have access to services and products regardless of location or digital proficiency. Strategic partnerships with companies like Bayer and INI Farms further enhance product offerings and market access.
